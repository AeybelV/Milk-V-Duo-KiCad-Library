# Milk-V Duo Module 01 KiCad Footprints

KiCad symbol/footprint library for the Milk-V Duo Module 01, a
compact module with integrated SG2000, WI-FI6/BTDM5.4, and eMMC.

This library provides a multi-unit symbol and SMD footprint to utilize 
the module in your hardware designs.

The symbol is provides as a multi-unit symbol. Many of the pins on the 
module can have multiple functions (ex. a pin can serve as MIPI or GPIO).
KiCad supports alternate pin symbols, activate the desire alternate depending on your
design. This will allow you to keep symbol units cleans and unused functions are hidden.
